## jenkins github-webhook configuration

configurations needs to be done on the jenkins server pipeline job side and on github repo side

### 1) jenkins pipeline job configuration
- Select GitHub Project and paste in the repo URL (optional)  
- Under Build Triggers, select the checkbox next to GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling  
- Under Pipeline, select Pipeline script from SCM  
- Under SCM, select Git

- Save → Build Now  
    NOTE: The project must run at least one successful build before connecting to GitHub. This allows Jenkins to read the configuration from the repo
